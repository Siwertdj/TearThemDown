# Tear Them Down

This project was developed for the course 'Rapid Prototyping' at HKU as part of a gamejam with the theme of "Creepiest of Things" within 36 hours. The code and organisation herein is therefore not optimal.

## Description

'Tear Them Down' is a game set in a futuristic, dystopian setting where hordes of commoners rebel against the manipulative, untouchable and inhumane mega corporations and their robot-armies.
This project remains a prototype, but is playable as a proof of concept. The gimmick revolves around the player controlling not one character, but a crowd of 300 individuals, all at once, as they maneuver the gauntlet through the city, aiming to storm the Megacorps with the largest angry mob possible.

## How to play 

You can find and play the WebGL-build [here](https://siwertdj.itch.io/gamejam-submission-tearthemdown).

1. Use WASD to move the crowd towards the goal.
2. Avoid obstacles, such as firelines, rocketlaunchers and cars to keep your rebels alive.
3. Follow the on-screen arrow to your destination to storm the corporation's HQ and win.
